        <p>Meos is a collaborative fictive and conceptual project between UI and architecture students. <br>Given the task of envisioning the future of education, we conceived an innovative space where an augmented reality personal assistant would enhance teaching quality. This assistant would support individuals throughout their lives, identifying their needs and tailoring learning methods to promote a personalized educational experience.</p>

    <p>Both the interface and campus have been designed to improve student life and comfort. We imagined spaces that are simple and airy to optimize the use of Meos, personal education assistant. The goal was to offer personalized support for each student, according to their needs and abilities. The challenge was residing in how we could offer students and people, 24/7 assistance with an interface that wouldn’t be too opressing and distracting. We wanted to convey a smooth experience that would feel technological, yet natural.</p>
